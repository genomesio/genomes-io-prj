Main data was taken from supplementary table 2 of PMID 25282103.

The specific association model was described in this paper as according to their reference 6 (PMID 20881960). This is described as using "summary results of a linear regression of age-adjusted, within-sex Z scores of height against the imputed SNP". So Z-scores.

That could be a disadvantage or an advantage - perhaps we just report the Z-score? THe paper is solely European ancestry, however, so it could end up being awfully wrong if we note that it is relative to the normal distribution in a given country where the user comes from. Not much to do about it, and it probably is ok to just calculate the gheight variables as the number of height alleles times the beta, summed over all SNPs. That beta, or 'gheight' here, would then be a Z-score, and we could make the background a smoothscatter plot showing a normal distribution of gheights (1 being one SD above population mean, and -1 being one SD below population mean). That would work for the X-axis.

WHat about the Y-axis then. That's gotta be real centimeters, and it begs the very real question of what population we are talking about. The PMID 25282103 paper is Europeans only, but users could be from anywhere. The most accurate background would then probably be to take some kind of European mean +/- European SD. Just wish they'd report that in the paper, but I can't find it. It will have the obvious flaw if, say an Asian user perform the analysis - what's the error from the height-explaining SNPs that are at the same time ethnicity-explaining and thus potentially non-detected in PMID 25282103 - i.e. if there is for example a set of 'Chinese-only' height loci. ... for now, the answer probably is that we lack the data. For this purpose we therefore just base the background on some European average values.
