From Eriksson 2010 table S6 the hair colour data is retrieved. This is well-formatted with betas. The scale is:
"We performed two analyses of hair color: blond to brown and red versus not red. For blond to brown, we regressed an ordinal coding (0 = blond, 1 = dark blond, 2 = light brown, 3 = reddish brown, 4 = medium brown, 5 = dark brown, 6 = black) for hair color on the ordinal coding for genotype (0, 1, 2) as well as five principal components and sex.

For red versus non-red hair color, participants were asked to “describe the amount of red in my hair (before I went gray, if I am gray now)” with available choices “No red at all,” “A tinge of red,” “Some red” and “A lot of red” which were coded from 0 to 3 in a linear regression."
"
So probably something like a 0-12 scale for brownness and 0-6 for redness (but we'll see). In any case it should be converted to the 0-1 scale.
