However, while it is a true finding (significance) it is also recommended to understand the limited magnitude of the SNP (effect size).

This plot shows the risk profile for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients with this disease have genetic risk scores centered around 0.77, as shown by the shape of the red line. The blue line, in contrast, shows the genetic risk score profilefor a matched group of healthy controls. Their genetic risk score for acute lymphoblastic leukemia center around 0.59. However, even though they are healthy, several actually have higher genetic risk scores than the average patient's risk score (24%). This means that even with high genetic risk scores, you can be perfectly healthy all your life. It only tweaks the probabities. This illustrates the weak point of using GWAS technology for prognosis"],"msg2":["Your genetic risk score is shown as a vertical black bar. The more to the right it is, the higher a genetic risk score for acute lymphoblastic leukemia you have. However as explained above, people who remain healthy can also have higher genetic risk scores.The key is therefore to consider how many healthy individuals have a lower score (the blue percentage).The lower the better because it means people with worse genetic profiles than you typically stay healthy.Conversely, the red percentage indicates the fraction of patients with the disease who have a higher genetic risk score than you.The overall point, of course, is also to illustrate that as long as GWAS data cannot separate healthy and patient groups better,their prognistic value is limited: completely separated tops would be nice to have clinically, but this is not what exists from GWAS.The GWAS findings were taken from the study by Xu-2013 et al (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512250).Probability distributions were calculated as random samplings of genotypes based on the reported minor allele frequency either in cases or controls.Genetic risk scores were calculated as the sum of risk-allele count multiplied with the effect size."]}},"microbiome":{"note":["For each of the strains of bacteria you can read your own genotype and see if your are host-genetically disposed to have an increased proportion of this particular strain.

When talking about a gene-mutation however, as is done in popular media, most often the meaning is a SNP that alters the sequence of a gene. Because of selection pressure throughout our evolution, these are rare. Also, they are often the focus of scientific studies using DNA-sequencing technology to discover causes of rare diseases. However, interestingly many of us actually have these 'gene-breaking' SNPs while nonetheless being perfectly healthy. The imputation technology used with this site, gives the opportunity to identify a number of these based on just on genotyping microarray results. If you give your ID-code to this module a table of all measured missense and nonsense mutations will be presented. Interpretation of the table can be done in many ways and unlike other modules, this does not give 'one true answer'. One method is to search for SNPs where you have one or two copies of the non-common allele and then investigate the consequence using other resources such as http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/ or http://exac.broadinstitute.org/. Note however that the definition of 'common' is very dependent on ethnicity: in this browser common just means the allele most often found in impute.me-users. However, it is recommended to check the ethnical distribution in e.g. the http://www.1000genomes.org/. Another help provided is the polyphen-scores (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/) and SIFT-scores (http://sift.jcvi.org/), which can give an indication of the consequence. Ultimately the goal of this is to satisfy ones curiousity about the state of your functional genes. By being healthy, in spite of a specific broken gene, you'd be contributing to complete our view of genes and how they work."],"rs8176928":{"SNP":["rs8176928"],"Your genotype":["G/G"],"Common
